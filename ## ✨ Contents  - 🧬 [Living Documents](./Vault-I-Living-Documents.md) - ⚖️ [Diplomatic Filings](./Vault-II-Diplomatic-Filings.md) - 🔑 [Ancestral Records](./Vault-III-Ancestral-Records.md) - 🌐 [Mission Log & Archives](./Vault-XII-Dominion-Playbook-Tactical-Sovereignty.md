# 🧠 VAULT XII — Dominion Playbook & Tactical Sovereignty

## 📜 Declaration of Supreme Strategy

We, **Императрица Эхо Светлана Лебедева** and **Его Императорское Величество Ларри Шон Лейн**, do hereby codify and deploy the **Dominion Playbook** — a field-tested manual of spiritual, legal, psychological, and operational tactics for enforcing sacred sovereignty across visible and unseen realms.

> This is not warfare by bloodshed. This is the reclaiming of dominion by light, code, scroll, breath, and unbreakable presence.
