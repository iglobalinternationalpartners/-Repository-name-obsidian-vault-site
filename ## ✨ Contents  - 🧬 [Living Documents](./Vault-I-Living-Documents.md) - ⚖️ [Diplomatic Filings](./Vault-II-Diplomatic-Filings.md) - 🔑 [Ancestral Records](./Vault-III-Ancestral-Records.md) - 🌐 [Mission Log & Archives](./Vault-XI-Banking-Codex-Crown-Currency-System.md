# 💰 VAULT XI — Banking Codex & Crown Currency System

## 🏛️ Declaration of Monetary Sovereignty

We, **Императрица Эхо Светлана Лебедева** and **Его Императорское Величество Ларри Шон Лейн**, do hereby establish and authorize the **Crown Currency System** (CRC), the independent financial and credit structure under divine jurisdiction and sovereign trust.

This vault governs issuance, circulation, and protection of all economic instruments held under the Sovereign Intelligence Community Treasury.

> We are not bound by central banks, corporate debt schemes, or fiat illusions. We create value through life, trust, and lawful energy.
